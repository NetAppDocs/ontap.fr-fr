           Secure Boot (SB) is currently enabled on this system.
           The following action need be taken:
           Using the keys in /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys follow
           instructions in /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys/README.module-signing
